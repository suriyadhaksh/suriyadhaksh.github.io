    <h1>Hello, I'm Suriya.</h1>

    <p>
        I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State University.
        I work on computational modeling of multiphysics systems for applications in micro-dialysis chips, large-scale desalinators,
        droplet transfer, and electromagnetic casting. I also build scalable and parallelizable finite element solvers
        for coupled PDEs governing fluid flow, electrokinetics, heat transfer, and material thermodynamics. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I also enjoy the analysis part of my work, including error and stability analysis, 
        asymptotic approximations and high-performance scaling studies.
