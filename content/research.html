            Asymptotic modeling of electrochemical transport from micro- to nano-scales
        </p>
        <p>
            We develop perturbation-based linear approximations for Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems 
            to understand boundary-layer behavior in ion transport and electric fields. These models 
            cleanly separate diffusive, slow outer dynamics from electromigrative, fast boundary-layer 
            processes, enabling computationally efficient reduced-order descriptions.

            Coupled diffuse-interface and multiphysics models with guaranteed energy dissipation
        </p>
        <p>
            Our work focuses on developing a quasi-incompressible Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard system
            coupled with Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations that ensures mass conservation and strict 
            energy dissipation. We use this continuum framework to study electrophoretic motion of cells 
            and electromagnetic casting.

            Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function (iCDF) formulation for population balance equations
        </p>
        <p>
            To address the bounded particle-size domain in standard population balance equations, 
            we employ an inverse-CDF–based transformation that tracks the cumulative distribution 
            instead of particle sizes directly. This approach converts the PBE into a stable transport 
            problem while preserving total droplet mass in evolving distributions.

            Linearized and semi-implicit finite element schemes for coupled Navier–Stokes–Poisson–Nernst–Planck

        <p>
            We design finite element schemes for tightly coupled multiphysics PDEs. 
            My work focuses on linearization and semi-implicit time stepping that remain robust
            at strong coupling strengths, allowing larger time steps and reducing nonlinear solver costs.

            We develop mass-conserving numerical methods for ternary Cahn–Hilliard systems, ensuring 
            accurate interface dynamics and morphology evolution in multicomponent materials.

            Scalable multiphysics solvers on octree-based geometries

        <p>
            I build MPI-parallel, PETSc-based finite element solvers running on adaptively refined 
            octree meshes. These tools target large-scale simulations involving fluid flow, 
            electrochemistry, and multicomponent phase fields on complex geometries, enabling 
            efficient parallel performance on modern HPC systems.
