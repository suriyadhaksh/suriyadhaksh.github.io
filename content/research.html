            Asymptotic modeling of electrochemical transport 
        </p>
        <p>
            We develop perturbation-based linear approximations for Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems 
            to understand the extremely thin boundary-layer behavior of ion transport and electric fields near domain boundaries. 
            These models separate slow, diffusive, outer dynamics from fast, electromigrative boundary-layer 
            processes, enabling computationally efficient reduced-order descriptions.

        <p>
            Our work focuses on developing a quasi-incompressible Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard system
            coupled with Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations that ensures mass conservation and strict 
            energy dissipation. Using this continuum framework, we aim to study electrophoretic motion of
            cells and phase evolution in electromagnetic casting.

            Inverse Cumulative Distribution Formulation (iCDF) for population balance equations
        </p>
        <p>
            To address the bounded particle-size domain in standard population balance equations, 
            we employ an inverse-CDF–based transformation that tracks the cumulative distribution 
            instead of particle sizes distribution directly. This approach converts the PBE into a
            stable transport problem while preserving total droplet mass in evolving distributions.

        <p>
            Our work focuses on developing semi-implicit finite element schemes for NS-PNP system to simulate
            electrohydrodynamic phenomena. We aim to achieve fully linearized updates with large time steps,
            reducing nonlinear solver costs and enabling GPU acceleration to simulate stiffer flow regimes.

            We design mass-conserving and energy-stable numerical methods for ternary Cahn–Hilliard systems
            to generate diverse material morphological data sets for various systems' chemistry.

        <p>
            We build MPI-parallel, PETSc-based finite element solvers running on adaptively refined 
            octree meshes. These tools target large-scale simulations involving fluid flow, 
            electrochemistry, heat transfer and multicomponent phase fields on complex geometries, enabling 
            efficient parallel performance on modern HPC systems.
