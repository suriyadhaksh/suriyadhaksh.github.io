                Asymptotic modeling of electrochemical transport

            <p>
                We develop perturbation-based linear approximations for Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems 
                to understand the extremely thin boundary-layer behavior of ion transport and electric fields near domain boundaries. 
                These models separate slow, diffusive, outer dynamics from fast, electromigrative boundary-layer 
                processes, enabling computationally efficient reduced-order descriptions.

            <p>
                Our work focuses on developing a quasi-incompressible Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard system
                coupled with Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations that ensures mass conservation and strict 
                energy dissipation. Using this continuum framework, we aim to study electrophoretic motion of
                cells and phase evolution in electromagnetic casting.

                Inverse Cumulative Distribution Formulation (iCDF) for population balance equations
            </p>
            <p>
                To address the bounded particle-size domain in standard population balance equations, 
                we employ an inverse-CDF–based transformation that tracks the cumulative distribution 
                instead of particle sizes distribution directly. This approach converts the PBE into a
                stable transport problem while preserving total droplet mass in evolving distributions.

                Our work focuses on developing semi-implicit finite element schemes for NS-PNP system to simulate

                reducing nonlinear solver costs and enabling GPU acceleration to simulate stiffer flow regimes.

                We build MPI-parallel, PETSc-based finite element solvers running on adaptively refined 
                octree meshes. These tools target large-scale simulations involving fluid flow,

            We use the Smash framework (Science–Modeling–Algorithm–Software–Hardware), 
            adapted from the RIKEN Center for Computational Science, as a
            structured way to classify computational research problems. 
            It helps characterize work based on scientific motivation, model formulation, 
            numerical algorithm development, software engineering, and hardware design.
