            Asymptotic modeling for electrochemical transport phenomena at micro-scales
        </p>
        <p>
            I develop perturbation-based and multiscale approximations for Poisson–Nernst–Planck systems 
            to understand ion transport, potential structure, and boundary-layer behavior. These models 
            separate slow outer dynamics from fast interfacial processes, producing interpretable and 
            efficient reduced-order descriptions.

            Coupled diffuse-interface and multiphysical models ensuring energy dissipativeness
        </p>
        <p>
            My work includes building thermodynamically consistent formulations—particularly 
            Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard models—where flow, concentration, and interfaces evolve
            together while maintaining an energy-dissipation structure. This enables stable 
            long-time simulations of phase separation and interfacial transport.

            Population balance equation modeling using cumulative distribution function representation
        </p>
        <p>
            I explore CDF-based transformations of population balance equations to track particle 
            size distributions without introducing numerical diffusion. This approach converts the 
            PBE into a stable transport problem that preserves sharp features in evolving distributions.

            Linearized and semi-implicit finite element schemes for coupled Navier–Stokes–Poisson–Nernst–Planck
        </p>
        <p>
            I design stable finite element strategies for tightly coupled multiphysics PDEs. 
            My work focuses on linearization and semi-implicit time stepping that remain robust
            at strong coupling strengths, allowing larger time steps and reducing nonlinear solver costs.

        <p>
            I develop mass-conserving numerical methods for ternary Cahn–Hilliard systems, ensuring 
            accurate interface dynamics and morphology evolution in multicomponent materials.

            Scalable multiphysics solvers on octree-based geometries

        <p>
            I build MPI-parallel, PETSc-based finite element solvers running on adaptively refined 
            octree meshes. These tools target large-scale simulations involving fluid flow, 
            electrochemistry, and multicomponent phase fields on complex geometries, enabling 
            efficient parallel performance on modern HPC systems.
